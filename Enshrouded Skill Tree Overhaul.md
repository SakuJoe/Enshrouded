##### \*GENERAL NOTES\*

##### 

The guiding idea behind these changes was to make the game more engaging and to further diversify gameplay. The goal was to rethink skill trees and skill interactions without completely redesigning the existing systems.



While it is natural for players to want their favorite builds to remain powerful, the primary objective was to ensure that all builds can be both viable and enjoyable. In addition, these changes aim to support different playstyles, ranging from relaxed, casual play to hardcore-oriented gameplay.



Existing builds are intended to remain viable, even though some skills have been adjusted or nerfed in this version. These changes mainly target excessive stun-focused strategies that trivialize difficulty, even in Hardcore mode, through repetitive mechanics such as Explosive Arrows + Shell Shock or Chain Lightning + Terror. In exchange, revised versions of these builds require more deliberate execution while offering greater rewards for skilled play. Naturally, this iteration is not perfectly balanced, as many of these changes were designed without the ability to properly test them.



Based on community feedback observed on Discord, several recurring issues were addressed: improving early-game mana regeneration for mages by offering more restoration options through skill nodes, enhancing necromancy mechanics, improving dagger gameplay, correcting misplaced or illogical skill tree nodes, and providing stronger incentives for underused perks. The tank-oriented branches were also expanded to make tanking both viable and enjoyable, and certain weapon perks —particularly Vicious— are more interesting now for solo melee play (see Bash).



Finally, some gem interactions were integrated directly into the skill tree. The tank-related interactions, in particular, feel fun, strong and thematically coherent. That said, the number of gem synergies is still limited, and further ideas could be explored. Community feedback will play an important role in determining whether and how these interactions should be expanded in the future.

*Keep in mind that there are other small tweaks I had in mind that are not described in these notes. This includes things like minor nodes (Constitution, Endurance, Intelligence, etc.), which were also rearranged so that certain branches of the skill tree no longer force players to spend skill points on nodes that are useless for their build. For example, the Athlete branch is now almost entirely Constitution-focused, while Survivor is fully Endurance-oriented*.



I hope this work will provide new ideas to the Devs and help them to build this great game.



##### \*Side notes about the Greatsword\*



This weapon needs a bit of tweaking. Most of us agree that the Greatsword should have a two-hit combo so it can be on par with the other two-handed weapons in terms of Whirlwind Crescendo accessibility. We also agree that the weapon currently feels too slow, but this issue should be resolved once the Heavy Specialization perk starts working with the Greatsword.



Another point that has been debated is whether the Greatsword should have horizontal strikes instead of vertical ones. I would like to address this argument: please stop claiming that the Greatsword should have horizontal strikes because that is how it was historically used — this is a misconception. Historically, depending on the type of greatsword (zweihänder, nodachi, miaodao, etc.), most strikes were diagonal or vertical (Zornhau, Oberhau, Unterhau, makko-giri, kesa-giri, etc.), with horizontal strikes mainly used to deal with cavalry.



From a gameplay perspective, I understand why players are asking for more cleave. However, what is the point of having a third two-handed weapon that does exactly the same thing? The Greatsword is interesting because it is different. Historically, these weapons were designed to fight multiple enemies by using diagonal downward and upward cuts to control space and make attacks less predictable.



Ideally, I would like to see the Greatsword have a standard two-hit combo with diagonal slashes that provide some cleave-like motion. However, if I had to choose between horizontal and vertical strikes, I would pick vertical strikes any day — for both gameplay reasons (positioning, timing, and stagger on hit) and historical accuracy.

##### \*MELEE\*



* **BASH**

Parrying an attack bashes the enemy, briefly exposing its back for 1s.

This duration is extended by +1s if the bashed enemy is struck from behind with a one-handed or two-handed weapon *(Duration can be extended only once)*.

Additionally, arrows can now be parried. Parried arrows are reflected back toward the enemy who fired them.

**Whirlwind Crescendo** can *also* be triggered by holding block for 2s, then attacking while still *blocking*

(Hold RMB for 2s, then press LMB while continuing to hold RMB).
